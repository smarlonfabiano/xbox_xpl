### Bugs that I exploited on Xbox One and Xbox Live.

1. Xbox Live - [Payment Bypass.txt](https://github.com/smarlonfabiano/xbox_xpl/blob/master/Xbox%20Live%20-%20Payment%20Bypass.txt):
Vulnerability that allowed the infinite purchase of XboxOne games on the Windows Store

2. Xbox Live - [Payment Bypass 2.0.txt](https://github.com/smarlonfabiano/xbox_xpl/blob/master/Xbox%20Live%20-%20Payment%20Bypass%202.0.txt):
Vulnerability in which it was possible to access development sandboxes and subscribe to all XboxLive services without having to pay.

When I find new bugs on XboxOne I will update them here.
