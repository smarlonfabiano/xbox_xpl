Through the Development Modes it is possible to subscribe to xbox services such as: XboxLive, Xbox Gamepass, Xbox Ultimate, Xbox Gamepass PC, etc. Bypassing any type of billing that would be carried out. In this way it is possible to subscribe to services as if you were in Retail mode, using a console in DevMode. The profile receives the service subscriber tag and still receives the subscription invoice.
