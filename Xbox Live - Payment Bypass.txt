# Version of Operational System: 10.0.18362.6065 (19h1_release_xbox_dev_1908.190807-1720)

It was possible to bypass the payment method, buy infinite games on Xbox Live and play them.
This bug was reproduced on XboxLive, but can be replicated on other gaming platforms and eccomerce.


POC:

Reproducing the bug:

1 - Register a valid card with your Xbox Live account.

2 - Cancel and block the credit card at the issuing bank.

3 - Now with an invalid card, you can buy the products in pre-order. - The second query to the gateway is carried out, however, as billing has the option to be billed 10 days before the release, you can download the games without being debited.

4 - The attempted debit of the registered card will be made 10 days before the product launch and you may receive several notifications informing you of the payment failure (Keep Calm and Bypass).

5 - At this point, we can find the fault or not, because depending on how the purchase is reversed, the product license may not be revoked (and yes, most of the time it is not).
  If there is an error in the reversal logic, when the product is released you will have the access/license normally.

6 - With this break of logic it is possible to buy infinite games and products from Microsoft without paying 1 cent.

Note: Is also possible use a prepaid card or paypal account without sufficient funds.
This bug has already been fixed, but there are other e-commerces that can be tested in the same way.
